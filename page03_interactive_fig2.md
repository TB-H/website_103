## Figure Description
For this type of plot, we have that the linear situation is on the left while the exponential is on the right. We can notice how this discreptancy is less noticeable as for those that have points that do not overlap with the interval appear for both models. I don't think this is very helpful metric on its own, though when zooming in, we can see how this allows us to zoom and make conclusions for each of the plots in which due to the fact they are 86 of them, I think I am going to focus on evaluating the second bacterium once we do a difference plot for our predictive regression. I can notice that for the most part, it appears that the two models fit the data well though there are still points towards the right end in particular that have deviation for both the linear and exponential model, considering how we are evaluating wether or not we have a linear or exponential model. Let's start by generating the samples, this time by using the actual times from the data as the time parameter.
