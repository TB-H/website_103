Abstract: >
  The researchers performed experimental and theoretical analysis for the quantitative 
  laws that govern the growth and division of individual Caulobacter crescentus cells in
  which we see how we have that they tested how temperature varies the growth and
  division timescales. They were able to show how a single temperature-dependent scale of
  cellular time governs the stochastic dynamics of growth and division in balanced growth
  divisions.
Summary:  >
  We looked at the data collected from the setup of imaging of single dividing cells in
  conditions that are identical over time. This approach involved taking advantage of how
  Caulobacter bacteria is adherent through to a surface through its stalk in which the
  daughter cell does not have a staulk and is mobile in which the duaghter cells are able
  to be washed away to allow for easier segmentation. We are looking at 20 growth events
  for one bacterium and 78 for another bacterium in which a growth event is defined as a
  time period in which a bacterium grows before dividing. We notice how bacteria grow
  exponentially though we are curious on how to model an individual event.
  
  We are working with assuming that we have normally distributed residuals in which
  
  \begin{align}
  a_i \sim \text{Norm}(a(t_i;a_0, k), \sigma_i) \;\forall i.
  \end{align}
  
  We will start by defining the model in which we have a Normal model with homoscedasticity in which the variances are equal such that we have the following
  homoscedastic model (in which we are doing so to make the calculations a bit nice):
  
  \begin{align}
  a_i \sim \text{Norm}(a(t_i;a_0, k), \sigma) \;\forall i
  \end{align}
  
  in which we have that the PDF would be
  
  \begin{align*}
  f(a_i ; t_i,a_0, k), \sigma) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp{\left( \frac{-1}{2 \sigma^2} (a_i - a(t_i;a_0, k))^2 \right)}
  \end{align*}
  
  in which the likelihood function is
  
  \begin{align*}
  L (t_i, a_0, k, \sigma; a_i) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \exp{\left( \frac{-1}{2 \sigma^2} (a_i - a(t_i;a_0, k))^2 \right)}
  \end{align*}
  
  and the log likelihood function is
  
  \begin{align}
  \ell(t_i, a_0, k, \sigma; a_i) = -\frac{n}{2}\,\ln 2\pi - \sum_i \ln \sigma_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_i \left(\frac{a_i - a(t_i;a_0, k)}{\sigma}\right)^2.
  \end{align}

  We will

  \begin{align}
  \ell(t_i, a_0, k, \sigma; a_i) = -\frac{n}{2}\,\ln 2\pi - \sum_i \ln \sigma_i - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\sum_i \left(a_i - a(t_i;a_0, k)\right)^2.
  \end{align}

  in which we can notice how the sum has no $\sigma$ dependence in which we can focus on minimizing the RSS in which we can apply the same methodology from 8.1
  and then notice how  $\sigma^* = \sqrt{\text{RSS}^*/n}$ for its MLE, again following the logic for a Normal homoscedastic model.
  We will apply this model for both the linear and exponential equations. 
  
  
  To determine which function fits our data well, we will calculate the AIC for it, recalling that the formula is
  
  \begin{align}
  \text{AIC} = -2\ell(\theta^*;\text{data}) + 2p,
  \end{align}
  
  and that $p$ is the number of free parameters in which we will define the log likelihood for a single bacterium and growth event.
  We found that the AIC for the linear model was much lower than the exponential model such that the weight for the linear model was 
  nearly zero, causing us to rule it out.
