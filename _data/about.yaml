Abstract: >
  The researchers performed experimental and theoretical analysis for the quantitative 
  laws that govern the growth and division of individual Caulobacter crescentus cells in
  which we see how we have that they tested how temperature varies the growth and
  division timescales. They were able to show how a single temperature-dependent scale of
  cellular time governs the stochastic dynamics of growth and division in balanced growth
  divisions.
Summary:  >
  We looked at the data collected from the setup of imaging of single dividing cells in
  conditions that are identical over time. This approach involved taking advantage of how
  Caulobacter bacteria is adherent through to a surface through its stalk in which the
  daughter cell does not have a staulk and is mobile in which the duaghter cells are able
  to be washed away to allow for easier segmentation. We are looking at 20 growth events
  for one bacterium and 78 for another bacterium in which a growth event is defined as a
  time period in which a bacterium grows before dividing. We notice how bacteria grow
  exponentially though we are curious on how to model an individual
